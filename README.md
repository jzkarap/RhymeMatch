# RhymeMatch
* RhymeMatch will be a drag-and-drop game for young children to practice rhyming words

<img src="https://github.com/jzkarap/RhymeMatch/blob/master/RhymeGame.gif?raw=true">

Currently, it displays only within browser console. It makes calls to datamuse API to get a target word and a selection of rhyming words. It will repeat calls until it accepts a sufficient amount of rhyming matches to build a game. An equal number of non-rhyming words is called. Rhyming words and non-rhyming words are intermixed and randomly placed across screen within the display.

Interact.js library is used to handle drag and drop events.

<h2>To-Do</h2>
[x] Generate DOM elements that take information from API call <br>
[x] Allow drag-and-drop interface so players can interact with those generated elements <br>
[x] Build an array of non-rhyming words to provide a challenge for budding logophiles <br>
[ ] Style to make it look nice <br>
[ ] Clean up code so it doesn't look like such a Frankenstein monster
