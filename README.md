# RhymeMatch
* RhymeMatch will be a drag-and-drop game for young children to practice rhyming words

Currently, it displays only within browser console. It makes calls to datamuse API to get a target word and a selection of rhyming words. It will repeat calls until it accepts a sufficient amount of rhyming matches to build a game.

<h2>To-Do</h2>
[x] Generate DOM elements that take information from API call <br>
[x] Allow drag-and-drop interface so players can interact with those generated elements <br>
[x] Build an array of non-rhyming words to provide a challenge for budding logophiles <br>
[ ] Style to make it look nice
